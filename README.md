# TruckLoadCreator

This program is created for the purpose of creating a planned way of loading trailers from the driver and passenger sides (typically flatbed and barn door trailers) in a visual and efficient way. In addition, the secondary goal is to reduce errors (forgotten items in truck, weight restrictions, wrong drop sequence, etc) that one may encounter without this software.
