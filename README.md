# TruckLoadCreator

This program is created for the purpose of creating a planned way of loading trailers from driver and passender sides (typically flatbeds and barndoor trailers) in a visual and effecient way. In addition, the secondary goal is to reduce errors (forgotten items in truck, weight restrictions, wrong drop sequence, etc) that one may encounter without this software.

The project leverages the following MIT licensed projects: jQueryUI, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sortable, Drawer, Fabric JS, and Open Iconic.
