# TruckLoadCreator

This program is created for the purpose of creating a planned way of loading trailers from the driver and passenger sides (typically flatbed and barn door trailers) in a visual and efficient way. In addition, the secondary goal is to reduce errors (forgotten items in truck, weight restrictions, wrong drop sequence, etc) that one may encounter without this software.

The project leverages the following MIT licensed projects: jQueryUI, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sortable, Drawer, Fabric JS, JsBarcode, and Open Iconic.
